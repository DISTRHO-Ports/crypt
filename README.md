![Build](https://github.com/DavW/crypt/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

**Crypt** is a software synthesiser plugin designed for creating spacious cold hyper-unisoned
synth sounds; developed by [Vitling](https://www.vitling.xyz) for the [Bow Church](http://bowchurch.bandcamp.com/) project.

It is written in C++17 and depends on the [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework, which is
included as a submodule.

## Download

Binaries for VST3, AU and Standalone apps are built automatically via GitHub Actions. However, I can only vouch for the macOS builds working, as I do not have the
means to test the Windows build. If you can test the Windows build then please let me know how it goes. Building for
Linux should be simple to DIY with CMake.

### Latest release:
